            "1. What is Generative AI and how does it differ from traditional AI? Answer: Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, including text, images, code, and other media, based on patterns learned from training data. Unlike traditional AI that typically classifies or predicts based on existing data, GenAI uses transformer architectures and large language models to generate novel outputs. Key differences include: Creative capability: GenAI can produce original content rather than just analyze existing data. Architecture: Uses transformer models with attention mechanisms vs. traditional rule-based or statistical models. Training approach: Trained on massive datasets using unsupervised learning techniques. Applications: Content creation, code generation, conversational AI vs. classification, regression, or optimization.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. What are the main challenges in deploying GenAI in enterprise environments? Answer: Key challenges include: Data privacy & security: Protecting sensitive information from model exposure. Governance & compliance: Meeting regulatory requirements and audit standards. Integration complexity: Connecting with existing enterprise systems and workflows. Cost management: Optimizing inference costs and resource utilization. Performance consistency: Ensuring reliable output quality and response times. Hallucination management: Preventing AI from generating false information. Change management: Training users and managing organizational adoption. Scalability: Handling enterprise-scale workloads and concurrent users.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. What are the key considerations for GenAI model selection? Answer: Model selection criteria: Performance requirements: Accuracy, speed, and output quality needs. Cost constraints: Training, inference, and infrastructure costs. Data requirements: Training data availability and quality. Deployment environment: Cloud, on-premises, or hybrid requirements. Compliance needs: Regulatory and security requirements. Scalability: Ability to handle expected load and growth. Customization needs: Fine-tuning capabilities and flexibility. Vendor ecosystem: Support, updates, and long-term viability.\n"
