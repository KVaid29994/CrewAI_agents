    "### Key features of CrewAI include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Role-based architecture***: Each AI agent is assigned a distinct role with defined capabilities and permissions, supporting modular and structured multi-agent systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Agent orchestration*** : CrewAI provides tools to coordinate agent behaviors and workflows, ensuring agents work together seamlessly\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Flexible communication***: Agents can exchange information through various channels, enabling effective collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Tool integration***: Agents can interact with external tools, such as web search engines and language models, to gather information and act on objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Customizability***: CrewAI offers deep customization of workflows, agent behaviors, and integration with different language models (LLMs), including OpenAI and local models"
